## Xtreme1's code and documentation

As you can see from [Xtreme1 GitHub](https://github.com/xtreme1-io/xtreme1), Xtreme1 code base mainly consists of two parts: Frontend (FE) and Backend (BE). Documents are also maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/xtreme1-io/docs), and deployed on [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/). Details of these components can be found in the following table:

| Component Name | Component Description | Related Language |
|----------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| [Frontend (FE)](https://github.com/xtreme1-io/xtreme1) | Xtreme1 web ui | JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS |
| [Backend (BE)](https://github.com/xtreme1-io/xtreme1)  | Xtreme1 api service | Java |
| [Docs](https://github.com/xtreme1-io/docs)        | Xtreme1 documents | Markdown |
